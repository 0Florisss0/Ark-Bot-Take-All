ARK: Survival Evolved Automation with GUI
This project provides an automation tool for "ARK: Survival Evolved" to streamline actions such as "Take All" by automatically detecting and clicking buttons on the screen. The tool includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to control the automation process and can work even when the game is in focus.

Features
Automatic Button Clicks: Automatically detects and clicks on specified icons in the right half of the screen, useful for repetitive tasks like "Take All."
GUI Interface: A simple GUI to start and stop the automation process.
Global Key Listener: Allows you to toggle the automation on and off using the F5 key.

Example
When the script is running, it will continuously search for the specified icon in the right half of the screen. If the icon is detected, the script will automatically click on it. This is useful for automating repetitive tasks in ARK: Survival Evolved.

Notes
Ensure that the game window is not obstructed by other windows and the screen resolution matches the one used for image matching.
The script may need adjustments based on updates to the game or changes in UI elements.

if Wilcard wants this removed it will be removed.
